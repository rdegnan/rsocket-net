        //This class is based heavily on the SignalR WebSocketsTransport class from the AspNetCore project. It was merged as release/2.2 as of this snapshot.
        //When designing Pipelines, for some reason, standard adapters for Sockets, WebSockets, etc were not published.
        //The SignalR team seems to be the driver for Pipelines, so it's expected that this code is the best implementation available.
        //Future updaters should review their progress here and switch to a standard WebSockets => Pipelines adapter when possible.

        //The verbatim copyright messages are below even though the code has been altered. The license is below as well.

        //Adapters for keeping the SignalR source as close to verbatim as possible. The SignalR code is a little junky here because it takes deeper dependencies than needed - most of this should be extracted in the constructor, but it's saved as a heavy reference only to be consumed once.
